- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichaelEhnes
- 👀 I’m interested in all things programming related
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new and fun projects!

I'm a software engineer that loves to come up with new ideas and test the waters of what's already there. No use in re-inventing the wheel, but there is use in chipping
off spots to make sure it turns smoothly!
